LOCALISED ENSEMBLE LEARNING (LEL) 
Global approaches, while effective in addressing overall class im-balance, often fail to account for the nuanced distributions and localized characteristics of minority classes. Inspired
by this limitation, researchers have shifted their focus toward localized methods, which prioritize identifying and preserving the unique patterns of minority instances within their local
neighborhoods. LEL incorporates this philosophy into a three-phase process:
1) Phase 1: Identification of sample types (Safe, Border- line, Rare) within the dataset.
2) Phase 2: Customized treatment of each sample type using targeted techniques.
3) Phase 3: Construction of an ensemble that emphasizes minority class learning through algorithm-level oversam-pling.
